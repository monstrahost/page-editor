It is an implementation of [wyishtml5 by Xing](http://xing.github.io/wysihtml5/), but that project is no longer maintained. The core of the project was built by Mancho Varela (@nakome).

Click the _Install_ button to activate. \r\n\r\n-  You will need to *deactivate other 'editor' plugins* like Summernote, CKEditor, CLeditor, or TinyMCE if you have them installed.
